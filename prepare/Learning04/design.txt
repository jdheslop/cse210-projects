    Attributes:
        private string _studentName;

    Getters / Setters:

Derived Class: MathAssignment - Base: Assignment
    Attributes:
        ASSIGNMENT: private string _studentName;
        ASSIGNMENT: private string _topic;
        private string _textbookSection;
        private string _sectionProblems;

        A Math assignment may need to store the student's name, the topic (for example, "Fractions"), the textbook section (for example, "7.3"), and the problems from that section (for example, "3-10, 20-21").

    Constructors:   
        MathAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string textbookSection, string sectionProblems) : base(studentName, topic)

        The Math assignment should have a constructor that requires a value for each of the items that it stores.

    Getters / Setters:
    Methods:
        ASSIGNMENT: AssignmentSummary()
            _studentName, _topic
        public string MathHomeworkList()
            _textbookSection, _sectionProblems

        The Math assignment needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment that contains the student's name and the topic, and it also needs to provide a method to display the Math homework list including the section number and the problems (for example, "Section 7.3 Problems 8-19").


Derived Class: WritingAssignment - Base: ASSIGNMENT
    Attributes:
        ASSIGNMENT: private string _studentName;
        ASSIGNMENT: private string _topic;
        private string _assignmentTitle;

        A writing assignment may need to store the student's name, the topic (for example, "European History"), and the title of the assignment (for example, "The Causes of World War II").

    Constructors:
        WritingAssignment(string studentName, string topic, string assignmentTitle) : base(studentName, topic)

        The writing assignment should have a constructor that requires a value for each of the items that it stores.

    Getters / Setters:
    Methods:
        ASSIGNMENT: AssignmentSummary()
            _studentName, _topic
        public string WritingInformation()
            _assignmentTitle, _studentName

        The writing assignment needs to provide a method to return a summary of the assignment that contains the student's name and the topic, and it also needs to provide a method to get the writing information which consists of the title and the student's name (for example, "The Causes of World War II by Mary Waters").
