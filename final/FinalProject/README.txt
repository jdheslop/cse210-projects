Jackson Heslop - CSE 210 Final Project

In my professional, private, and Church responsibilities, I meet a lot of people and participate in a lot of meetings and discussions. Because of the amount of discussions and people, I sometimes find it difficult to remember key information, my to do items, and items to discuss with others. I would like to write a program to help me track these items.

The program will track the following items:
- To Do Items (items for me to do)
    - Items with no date
    - Items with a target date
- Items to discuss with others
