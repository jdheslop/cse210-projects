Final Project Plan
Jackson Heslop

Open-Ended Project

In my professional, private, and Church responsibilities, I meet a lot of people and participate in a lot of meetings and discussions. Because of the amount of discussions and people, I sometimes find it difficult to remember key information, my to do items, and items to discuss with others. I would like to write a program to help me track these items.

The program will track the following items:
- To Do Items (items for me to do)
    - Items with no date
    - Items with a target date
- Items to discuss with others
    - Items with no date
    - Items with a target date
- Items which are information that are associated with a person or meetings
    - Items of information
    - To do Items for me
    - Items to discuss with others

The program will need to have a series of menus to show the available options. 
    - Display To Do Items (with option to close items)
        - for today
        - overdue
        - no date
    - Display Items to Discuss (with option to close items)
    - Display Future Items (with option to close items)
    - Display Closed Items
    - Display Notes from a Meeting (with option to close a meeting)
        - Add items to a meeting
    - Create a New Meeting or Person
    - Create a To Do Item (assigned to either a person or date)
    - Save to File
        - People
        - Meetings
        - Items
    - Load from File
        - People
        - Meetings
        - Items
    - Quit




Maybe:
- Prep Items: Notes that I can make to prepare for meetings.
- Birthday
- ToDo items that repeat
- Meetings are repeat meetings or single meetings
